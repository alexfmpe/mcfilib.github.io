  About
</h2>

FÃ ilte! I'm a Ruby on Rails and Haskell developer currently working remotely in Cardiff. I enjoy writing music in my spare time and I'm currently learning Welsh. My research interests include machine learning and adaptive systems. I'm originally from Greenock but don't hold that against me.
