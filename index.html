<h2>
  About
</h2>

FÃ ilte! I'm a Ruby on Rails developer currently working by the sea and studying for an MSc in Intelligent Systems at the University of Sussex. I enjoy writing music in my spare time and I'm currently learning Scottish Gaelic. My research interests include Machine Learning and MIR (Music Information Retrieval). I'm originally from Greenock but don't hold that against me.
