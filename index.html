  Croeso! I'm a Ruby and Haskell developer currently working remotely from

  music in my spare time and I'm currently learning Welsh. My research interests
  include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">machine learning</a>
  and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_system">adaptive systems</a>.
  I'm originally from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenock">Greenock</a>
  but don't hold that against me.
